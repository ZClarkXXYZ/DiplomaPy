#This is an attempt of a recreation of Diplomacy in python.

##Unfortunately, as it is, it is very incomplete

Here is what it currenlty does:

- Creates a UI for 7 players to select their name and team.
- Creates a representation of the game board that is seen.
  (it should have been able to easily change as pieces move around based on the way it was made)

-Creates a UI for players to 
1. Change player currently active
2. command units (of the ones that are waiting for command)
3. reset commands of your units
4. message other players (secretly)


Packages used:

- Pillow: an image library. Used for creating the image of the board
- tkinter: simple UI interface library.


How to use it:
Run mainUI.py. From there you follow the prompts it gives you, or press buttons.
